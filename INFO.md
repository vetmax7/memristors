Models of Ni/h-BN/Ni from [Atomistic description of conductive bridge formation in two-dimensional material based memristor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41699-024-00465-w#Sec2)

The average interlayer distances of Ni–hBN and hBN–hBN, which are 2.05 Å and 3.13 Å, respectively, were taken from [High magnetoresistance of a hexagonal boron nitride–graphene heterostructure-based MTJ through excited-electron transmission](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2022/NA/D1NA00272D)
